While there is no cure for asthma,  the condition can be controlled  \t\t\t\t\tthrough the avoidance of triggers and access to preventative  medical care.  Common triggers include air pollution, cigarette smoke,  and allergens such as  \t\t\t\t\tcockroach dander and pollen.  When preventative medical care is  lacking and triggers are abundant, the risk of hospitalization for an  asthma attack goes up.</p>\r\n<p>Asthma hospitalization rate is a key equity indicator in our  region because it is preventable and disproportionately impacts poor and  minority children.  \t\t\t\t\tAnalysis by the Asthma Regional Council shows that the racial  distribution of asthma hospitalization rates presented here is mirrored  across New England, with minority  \t\t\t\t\tasthmatic children more likely than white asthmatic children to be  hospitalized for the condition<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/public-health/youth-asthma-hospitalization/#footnote1\">1</a>.  Using data unavailable for this Report Card, the Asthma Regional  \t\t\t\t\tCouncil also found that low income children were at increased risk of asthma hospitalization compared to wealthier youth.</p>\r\n<p>Poorly controlled asthma taxes the health care delivery system,  schools, and the employers of parents who must care for sick children,  according to the  \t\t\t\t\tAsthma Regional Council.  Nationwide, these direct health care  expenses and lost work time cost the economy $16 billion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/public-health/youth-asthma-hospitalization/#footnote1\">1</a>.   Aside from these societal-level burdens and  \t\t\t\t\tfinancial costs, asthma has individual and familial impacts. Asthma  is one of the leading causes of missed school days in the country,  placing those students with poorly  \t\t\t\t\tcontrolled asthma at an academic disadvantage.

In fact, the block groups receiving the highest number of releases  had higher than state average rates of poverty, single-headed  households, and unemployment.   \t\t\t\t\tLow-poverty areas, the report concluded, are home to very few  returning prisoners.</p>\r\n<div>With its clear racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic patterning  and serious individual and social consequences, incarceration helps  perpetuate patterns of inequity in our region. <a class=\"learnmore\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/public-safety/incarcerated-population/\">Learn more...</a></div>\r\n<div class=\"learnmoretxt\">The Sentencing Project, a non-profit  \t\t\t\t\tresearch and advocacy organization, cites not only higher crime  rates, but also inequitable access to resources, legislative decisions  (e.g., around sentencing guidelines), and overt racial bias (e.g., in  policing, sentencing, or other  \t\t\t\t\trealms in which individuals have discretion) as the main drivers of  racial/ethnic disparities in incarceration rates<a class=\"reference\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/reference-navigation/references/index.html#xlii\">xlii</a>.   Based on state data from 2009, over 40% of new prison admissions were  convicted of non-violent crimes, yet depending  \t\t\t\t\ton the nature of their crimes, convicts can be denied voting  rights, welfare, public housing, and food stamp benefits for life and  may be barred from government jobs. On the private job market, a history  of incarceration or felony conviction  \t\t\t\t\treduces the chances a former prisoner will get a job, let alone one  that pays a living wage.</div>\r\n<p class=\"learnmoretxt\">Families also suffer as a result of incarceration. Because most  individuals in the criminal justice system have few job prospects and  many lack access to public benefits, released prisoners often rely on  family members for housing.  \t\t\t\t\tHowever, federal laws allow an entire family to be evicted from  public housing if just one member of the household or a guest engages in  drug-related or other criminal activity.  These laws create tension for  families who must chose  \t\t\t\t\twhether to risk accepting someone released from prison into the  home, and the risk is real; in a 2002 report, the Massachusetts  Sentencing Commission found that 40% of the criminally sentenced  population recidivated within three years<a class=\"reference\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/reference-navigation/references/index.html#xliii\">xliii</a>.    \t\t\t\t\tChildren with incarcerated parents have also been shown to  experience negative mental health and educational impacts.  A 2005  report by the Urban Institute, a non-profit research organization,  describes that nationwide, half of all prisoners  \t\t\t\t\thave children under the age of 18, and that these children are at  risk of poor school performance, feelings of stigmatization, and  intergenerational patterns of criminal behavior as a result<a class=\"reference\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/reference-navigation/references/index.html#xliv\">xliv</a>.   Finally, mass incarceration impacts entire communities.  While the  relationship between incarceration and crime rates is complex,  sociologists and justice system researchers posit that neighborhoods in  which a high proportion of the  \t\t\t\t\tpopulation has been incarcerated experience increases in &ldquo;social  disorganization&rdquo; and less social cohesion and integration.  In short,  high rates of incarceration are thought to destabilize communities as  residents cycle in and out of the  \t\t\t\t\tprison system.  <a class=\"learnmore\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/public-safety/incarcerated-population/\">Learn more...</a></p>\r\n<div class=\"learnmoretxt\" style=\"display: block;\">\r\n<p>In such areas,  behavior is less likely to be regulated by informal social control, or  norms, and high rates of incarceration may actually give rise to more  crime<a class=\"reference\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/reference-navigation/references/index.html#i\">i</a>xlv.</p>\r\n<p>Returning  prisoners are also much more likely than the general  \t\t\t\t\tpopulation to have contracted HIV, Hepatitis C, Tuberculosis, or to  have developed a mental illness, all of which require expensive medical  care once prisoners are released and many of which carry risks of  contagion<a class=\"reference\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/reference-navigation/references/index.html#xlvi\">xlvi</a>.   Society at large also  \t\t\t\t\tpays the financial costs of incarceration.  According to the  Massachusetts Department of Correction, tax payers spend about $46,000  per prisoner per year in incarceration in Massachusetts.<a class=\"reference\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/reference-navigation/references/index.html#xlvii\">xlvii</a></p>\r\n<p>Given the negative impacts of incarceration, Commonwealth  residents can be glad that the state imprisons a relatively small share  of its population compared to the rest of the country.  According to the  Kaiser Family Foundation, Massachusetts  \t\t\t\t\thas lower than national average rates of incarceration, with 218  people incarcerated per 100,000 residents, compared with the national  average of 504 per 100,000 people<a class=\"reference\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/reference-navigation/references/index.html#xlviii\">xlviii</a>.   Further, the lasting socioeconomic and community impacts of  incarceration  \t\t\t\t\tcould be lessened in Massachusetts through the passage of Criminal  Offender Record Information (CORI) system reform.  CORI was initially  launched as a way to more easily collect and disseminate criminal  justice-related information for use within  \t\t\t\t\tthe criminal justice system, while protecting the privacy of those  with criminal records.  However, its use has now expanded to employers,  who use CORI information to screen potential employees.  Unfortunately a  lack of clarity and understanding of the  \t\t\t\t\tCORI system stands as an impediment for many ex-offenders seeking  work.  Consequently, CORI reports &ldquo;can have the effect of creating a  class of unemployable ex-offenders.&rdquo;  CORI stands as a major challenge  to economic development, particularly  \t\t\t\t\tin communities where residents are disproportionately involved with  the criminal justice system.  CORI disproportionately affects  low-income and immigrant communities and communities of color who have  historically been denied full access to the  \t\t\t\t\tregion&rsquo;s economic opportunities<a class=\"reference\" href=\"http://maps.mapc.org/stateofequity/reference-navigation/references/index.html#xlix\">xlix</a> .</p>\r\n</div>", "order": null, "topicarea": 6}}, {"pk": 17, "model": "indicators.indicator", "fields": {"findings": "<p>Crime rates are generally higher in the inner core than the surrounding  suburbs, with Chelsea, Boston, Lynn, and Everett suffering highest  violent crime rates in the region in 2008.
