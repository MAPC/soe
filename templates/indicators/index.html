	<p class="span-16 last">
		MetroFuture, the region's plan for growth through the year 2030, directs us to achieve this vision by eliminating unfair, preventable, and 
		systematic differences between groups that not only harm individuals and families, but threaten the vibrancy of our region.		
	</p>
	
	<p class="span-16 last">The MetroFuture region is one where:</p>
	
	<ul class="prepend-1 span-14 last">
		<li>A wider diversity of housing types are built in all of the region’s communities (Goal #16), 
			helping to combat racial/ethnic and income-based segregation (Goal #15),</li>
		<li>Historically disadvantaged communities are healthier, with increased access to healthy food (Goal #24), 
			green space (Goal #23), better air quality (Goal #22) and medical care (Goal #26),</li>
		<li>Healthy and convenient transportation options are available throughout the region, particularly in traditionally 
			under-served areas (Goal #44),</li>
		<li>All of the region’s residents are equipped with all of the tools they need to succeed in today’s economy (Goal #29), 
			and resources for small businesses and first-time homeowners will help many build wealth for future generations (Goal #38).</li>

		<h4>We are Becoming More Diverse</h4>
		
		<p>Metro Boston is changing.</p>
		
		<p>These demographic trends will have huge impacts on the region in decades to come, and the face of the region in 2030 will look substantially different than it did in 2010.<p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Our aging population is growing</li>
			<li>The youngest among us our most diverse residents</li>
			<li>We are increasingly foreign-born</li>

		<h4>We are Becoming Less Equal</h4>
		<p>Inequitable income distribution and highly segregated residential patterns not only harm individuals throughout their lives, 
			but hinder Metro Boston’s potential for equitable growth and prosperity. They are also systematic factors that underpin or 
			exacerbate many of the other findings in this report.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Income inequality is high in Metro Boston, and it’s growing.</li>
			<li>The region is highly segregated.</li>
			<li>Our regressive tax structure worsens income inequality.</li>
